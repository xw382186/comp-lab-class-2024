Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.295 nm, buffer size 0.095 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.223 nm, buffer size 0.023 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 42x42x42, spacing 0.119 0.119 0.119

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.17

This run will generate roughly 44 Mb of data
