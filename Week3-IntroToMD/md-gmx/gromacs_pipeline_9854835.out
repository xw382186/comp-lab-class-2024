Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.036 nm, buffer size 0.036 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory

Will read whole trajectory

Using frame at t = 100 ps

Starting time for run is 0 ps
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 28x28x28, spacing 0.148 0.148 0.148

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.22

This run will generate roughly 39 Mb of data
